# OpteraIconic
Optera Automotive Operating System 3.0

Optera Game Engine is now Optera Automotive OS. The original focus of this project is finally coming to life as we enter the third iteration of development. Optera PE laid the groundwork for a StdDraw-free development environment for 2D graphics, with a complete rewrite of the original program. Optera SE took the original code from PE and tweaked it for new applications and allowed us to add several significant features, including key input. And now, Optera Iconic, a rewrite of the original Optera PE, intends to be the next big step in RGSCA history.
